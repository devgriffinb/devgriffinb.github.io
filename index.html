    <h2>About Me</h2>  
      <p>Although I'm just now starting my formal education in software engineering, I have been learning how to code for the past two years. I'm excited to continue to learn through Thinkful's Engineering Immersion program and meet others in my cohort who share my passion for coding!</p> 
      <p>My end goal is to become a game designer but am currently just enjoying developing and expanding my skills as a developer.</p>
      <p>As an aspiring game designer, some of my favorite games from the past year have been:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Outer Wilds</li>
        <li>Hollow Knight</li>
        <li>Terraria</li>
        <li>Enter the Gungeon</li>
      </ol>
